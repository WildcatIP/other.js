other.js is a JavaScript library for building Chatternet features.

* **Rational** Multiple layers of abstraction, each explained in terms of the layer beneath, without "magic" (Ã  la the [Rational Web Platform](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZkV1PpPsJJgdSZOA10Jh0VrThR6D_Q0XWv_2B9-0gGE/edit)).
* **Robust** There's no need to think about environment. Features are written in vanilla [es6](http://es6-features.org/) code that is adapted to execute across our environments as needed ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on the server, [JavaScriptCore](http://nshipster.com/javascriptcore/) on iOS and [modern browsers](http://browsehappy.com/) on the web).
* **Ready to hack** Feature code is readable, succinct and pickup-able. We don't make assumption about the rest of your technology stack, so you can bring your fancy build process or just start typing.

See [motivation](MOTIVATION.md).

## Examples

### Core

* [Base Behaviors](pseudo/core/base.pseudo.js) &mdash; start here
* [Kick](pseudo/core/kick.pseudo.js) &mdash; kicks a user from a channel for 1 minute, uses data stored on channels and runAsServer

* [Rechat Simple](pseudo/core/rechat-simple.pseudo.js) &mdash; an implementation that doesn't require selecting a message
* [Map, ETA, Find](pseudo/core/map.pseudo.js) &mdash; maps and places
* [Channel Mentions](pseudo/core/channel-mentions.pseudo.js) &mdash; link-back posted to channels are mentioned in another channels
* [Web](pseudo/core/web.pseudo.js)

### Apps

* [Twitter](pseudo/apps/twitter.pseudo.js) &mdash; putting it all together, channels as app, identity creation

### Extras

* [Points](pseudo/extras/points.pseudo.js) &mdash; explores how new social features are added and self-teach, uses data stored on users
