A JavaScript library for building Chatternet features.

* **Rational** Multiple layers of abstraction, each explained in terms of the layer beneath. Never magic. Inspired by [rational web platform](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZkV1PpPsJJgdSZOA10Jh0VrThR6D_Q0XWv_2B9-0gGE/edit) principles.
* **Robust** Features are written in environment-agnostic [ES6](http://es6-features.org/) code that is adapted to execute across Other Chat's client or server environments as appropriate.
* **Rapid** Feature code is succinct and pickup-able. No assumptions about your technology stack, so bring your fancy build system or just start typing.
