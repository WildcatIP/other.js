// A domain-style app, where you go to have the postbot "hand" deliver messages more slow-mail style.
// You go to the #postoffice to send a letter and to get your letters.

#postoffice
  / - instructions and welcome
  /mailbox - where you get your mail
  /compose - where you send mail from

@postbot - bot that does the delivery of mail

Is there a compose screen? Feels like there should be. How do you do the sending? How do we make the form feel long-form instead of short?
