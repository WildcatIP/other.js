// The implementation of a read-only channel. By implementing in Otherscript, allows even base
// behaviors of channels to be hacked on.

// Seems like we want the ability to give channels composable behavior. How does that work?

// Maybe a channel-based list via channel data of people who can post?

/*

In the general case, do you install features like readonly as an ability on a domain, and then it becomes an option in the channel settings?

In this specfic case, it would be include it as a built-in feature of all channels.
